The official only guaranteed the presence of dinosaurs and introduced Mr. Travis as the Safari Guide. Eckels observed the futuristic office with wires and steel boxes, hearing a sound like a bonfire burning all of Time. He remembered the enticing advertisements promising a reversal of time with a mere touch of a hand, where everything could return to its beginning.\n"
