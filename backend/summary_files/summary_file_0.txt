The protagonist wakes up with a hangover after a night of partying with her younger cousin Maya and her friends. She sends Maya a photo of the girls in costume, including a stranger named Lee who impressed with her aged makeup. Despite not remembering taking the photo, she scrolls through other pictures from the night, including embarrassing selfies and a blurry image of a dead body, which she promptly deletes. The text also mentions Maya's enthusiasm for a murder mystery party, where each participant assumes a character and solves a fictional murder, a concept the protagonist initially hesitated to join.
